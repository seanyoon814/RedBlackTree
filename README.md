# RedBlackTree
Map implementation in C++ using a Red Black Tree.
Uses template variables so the user is flexible in what they want to store.
Standard dictionary notation; to create a new object one must have a "key" value, and the value they want to insert.
Insertion, removal, and searching are done at O(logn) time, while fixing the tree when Red Black Tree properties are violated is done in constant time.
